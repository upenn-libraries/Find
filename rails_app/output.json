Does this make them best friends? Can sharing the same social and physical environment make them similar? This study compares the approaches of dogs and cats living in the same household have towards humans and other pets as perceived by the owner. Questionnaires collected from 1270 people owning both dog(s) and cat(s) were analysed. Most dogs and cats living together are playful with familiar humans (76.2%) but dogs have a more sociable approach towards strangers and conspecifics than cats (P\u003c0.001). Moreover, the percentage of dogs that have a playful relationship with the owner (84.0%) was higher than cats (49.2%; P\u003c0.001). Dogs and cats living together eat in different places and show different mutual interactions: more dogs lick the cat (42.8%) and more cats ignore the dog (41.8%) than vice versa (P\u003c0.001). However, most dogs and cats sleep at least occasionally (68.5%) and play together (62.4%; P\u003c0.001). Although some body postures, such as the tail’s position, are interpreted differently by the two species, the greater proportions of dogs and cats show a relaxed response to several kinds of approaches of their roommate. Our questionnaire confirms the common beliefs about the sociability of the dog and the privacy of the cat, but this does not result in continuous internal struggles. Most cohabitations are peaceful. Moreover, it is true that they speak different languages, but they seem to understand each other well and interpret each other's approaches in the right way. Thus, aspiring owners should not blindly believe popular assumptions, but both knowledge and respect for species-specific pet behaviours are essential to establish a balance in the household.","Although popular culture describes them as mortal enemies, more and more often, dogs and cats live under the same roof.

Does this make them best friends? Can sharing the same social and physical environment make them similar? This study compares the approaches of dogs and cats living in the same household have towards humans and other pets as perceived by the owner. Questionnaires collected from 1270 people owning both dog(s) and cat(s) were analysed. Most dogs and cats living together are playful with familiar humans (76.2%) but dogs have a more sociable approach towards strangers and conspecifics than cats (P\u003c0.001). Moreover, the percentage of dogs that have a playful relationship with the owner (84.0%) was higher than cats (49.2%; P\u003c0.001). Dogs and cats living together eat in different places and show different mutual interactions: more dogs lick the cat (42.8%) and more cats ignore the dog (41.8%) than vice versa (P\u003c0.001). However, most dogs and cats sleep at least occasionally (68.5%) and play together (62.4%; P\u003c0.001). Although some body postures, such as the tail's position, are interpreted differently by the two species, the greater proportions of dogs and cats show a relaxed response to several kinds of approaches of their roommate. Our questionnaire confirms the common beliefs about the sociability of the dog and the privacy of the cat, but this does not result in continuous internal struggles. Most cohabitations are peaceful. Moreover, it is true that they speak different languages, but they seem to understand each other well and interpret each other's approaches in the right way. Thus, aspiring owners should not blindly believe popular assumptions, but both knowledge and respect for species-specific pet behaviours are essential to establish a balance in the household."],"Keywords":["ANIMALS","DOMINANCE","VETERINARY BEHAVIORISTS ADVICE","FELIS-CATUS","CRITICAL PERIOD","HUMANS","PREVENTION","EMOTIONS","CANIS-FAMILIARIS","UNDESIRABLE

This study aimed to investigate factors related to ‘only desirable’ puppy behaviour (defined as being uninterested, ignored the cat or interacted in a calm way) towards existing household cats following introduction. Owners’ perceptions of the emerging cat-dog relationships were also explored. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to examine survey data collected as part of an ongoing study of dog health and behaviour. Of 4678 puppies, 26.7% lived with at least one cat. At the time of survey completion, 1211 puppies had been introduced to the household cat. The most common behaviours shown towards cats by puppies were: playing (58.9%), being overexuberant or over-excited (56.6%) and chasing (48.6%). Just 7.3% of puppies showed ‘only desirable’ behaviours. Puppies were more likely to show ‘only desirable’ behaviours when introduced before 12 weeks of age, gradually, and when they lived in a household with other dogs(s). Two styles of introductions were identified—owner-led and pet-led. Owners’ expectations of the cat-dog relationship differed depending on the style of introduction. Early, gradual, owner-led introductions of puppies to household cats can help them form a friendly relationship.Abstract Although cats and dogs can live amicably, inter-species conflict can result in poor welfare.

Species introduction can impact the development of the cat-dog relationship. This study aimed to identify factors associated with owner reported ‘only desirable’ puppy behaviour (defined as the puppy being uninterested, ignored the cat and/or interacted in a calm way) following introduction to existing household cats, and to explore perceptions of the emerging cat-dog relationship. Owner-reported data collected as part of a longitudinal study of canine health and behaviour were used. Of 4678 puppies, 26.7% lived with at least one cat. Of the 1211 puppies who had been introduced to the household cat at the time of survey completion, playing (58.9%), being overexuberant or over-excited (56.6%), and chasing (48.6%) were the most common behaviours displayed towards cats. ‘Only desirable’ behaviours were shown by 7.3% of puppies. Multivariable logistic regression showed early (puppies aged \u003c12 weeks), gradual introductions and living in a multi-dog household increased the odds of ‘only desirable’ behaviours. Qualitative analysis revealed two styles of introductions—owner-led and pet-led. Owners who led introductions anticipated amicable relationships between pets, whilst owners who let pets introduce themselves did not. Early, gradual, owner-led introductions of puppies to household cats should be encouraged."],"Keywords":["cat behaviour","cats","puppy behaviour","cat-dog relationships","dog
