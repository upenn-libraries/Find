  # Copied from Blacklight version 8.1.0
  # Added alert-dismissable os that the layout puts
  # the close "X" in the upper right.
  # Also, the button was a weird element named button_tag
  # but we need it to be button to be accessible.
  # Additionally, sanitizing message so that we can include html.
