# Find - A Penn Libraries Catalog

This application is the front end for the Penn Libraries catalog. It uses 
[Blacklight](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight) to facilitate searching and display of records from a Solr
index. Records are harvested from our ILS (Alma) by the 
[`catalog-indexing`](https://gitlab.library.upenn.edu/dld/catalog/catalog-indexing) app, and parsing of MARC is handled 
by the [`pennmarc`](https://gitlab.library.upenn.edu/dld/catalog/pennmarc) gem 
([docs](https://rubygems.org/gems/pennmarc)).

High-level information about this repo and the available working environments can be found at the [top-level README](README.md).

## Local Development Environment

### Requirements

Your development machine will need the following:

#### Ruby

I suggest installing Ruby via [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/). There is
plenty of guidance available on the open web about installing and using these tools. The `.ruby-version` and
`.tool-versions` files in this repo explicitly define the version of Ruby to be installed.

> __Important Note:__ The available Vagrant environment relies on a Bundler configuration that houses the installed gems in the `vendor/bundle` directory.
> If you want to use local services, and a local Ruby interpreter (via `rbenv`, `asdf` or somesuch), you'll need to instruct bundler to ignore this configuration when running commands with `bundle` (including `bundle exec`).
>
> To ignore the vagrant-specific Bundler config in a terminal session, run `export BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG=true`. Alternatively, you cna prepend the environment variable with each command; e.g. `BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG=true bundle exec rails c`.

#### Docker Compose

[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is required to run the application services. For ðŸŒˆ linux 
users ðŸŒˆ this is free and straightforward. [Install docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and then
[add the compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-the-plugin-manually).

For Mac users, the easiest and recommended way to get Docker Compose is to 
[install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). While this is enough to get the 
application running, you should request membership to the Penn Libraries Docker Team license 
from [the IT Helpdesk](https://ithelp.library.upenn.edu/support/home) for full functionality.

#### Development Credentials
 
Building the Vagrant environment should pull in the needed development key. If using the Vagrant environment for development, all secret values will be pulled from Vault. 

Settings files are, and should continue to be, structured to support credentials being made available by different means. For example, the Alma API keys is available via `DockerSecrets` in the Vagrant environment, but via the encrypted credential file when not using the Vagrant environment.

New credential values added to the Settings should be added **BOTH** to the Penn Vault as well as the encrypted Rails `development.yml.enc` file. This can be done with:

```bash
EDITOR=nano bundle exec rails credentials:edit -e development
```

### Starting App Services

Helpful Rake tasks have been created to wrap up the initialization process for the development environment. Prior to
starting this app, ensure you have a copy of the Solr configset and some sample data from another developer or by 
running the appropriate commands in the `catalog-indexing` project and copying those files into the `solr` directory.
For more information, see [Loading Data](#loading-data).

```
# start the app docker services, provision Solr collections and databases if not present, and run database migrations
rake tools:start

# stop docker services
rake tools:stop

# remove docker containers
rake tools:clean
```

### Loading Data

The `rake tools:start` command should ensure that the latest Solr config and sample data set ae loaded. Prior to running
this task, ensure you have a copy of the Solr configset as a zip file as well as a sample records `jsonl` file in the
`solr` directory. If the Solr container doesn't already have collections created, the `tools:start` command will attempt
to create new collections using the newest `configset_*.zip` file in the `solr` directory, then load the records in the 
newest `solrjson_*.jsonl` file in the `solr` directory.

### Developing

#### Install dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

##### Postgres
For MacOS users the `pg` gem may fail to install with an error concerning the `libpq` library.

[Refer to this gist](https://gist.github.com/tomholford/f38b85e2f06b3ddb9b4593e841c77c9e) to address this issue.

#### Start the development server

```bash
bundle exec rails server
```
 
View the app at `localhost:3000`

### Start the development server in RubyMine

In order for Rubymine to properly identify your Rails executable, you should open the project in in the `rails_app` directory. Additionally, you will have to edit your run configuration to include the following environment variable: `BUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG=true`. Details about this can be found in the [top-level README](README.md#working-with-local-services-in-docker). Assuming you have configured your Ruby SDK (to use `rbenv` or `asdf`) in RubyMine, you should be able to run the Rails server from the IDE. If you'd like to run the server in debugging mode, Rubymine will prompt you to install the necessary debugging gems if you have not already done so. Additionally, you will have to set an environment variable for the server to run successfully.

## Contributing

In order to contribute productively while fostering the project values, familiarize yourself with the established
[Gitlab Collaboration Workflow](https://upennlibrary.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLD/pages/498073672/GitLab+Collaboration+Workflow)
as well as the [Ruby on Rails Development Guidelines](https://upennlibrary.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLD/pages/495616001/Ruby-on-Rails+Development+Guidelines).

### Running the Test Suite

When adding new features, be sure to consider the need for test coverage.

Run the full application test suite with:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### Rubocop

This project is committed to the code style embodied in [`upennlib-rubocop`](https://gitlab.library.upenn.edu/dld/upennlib-rubocop). You can check for issues by running:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```
