https://penn.museum/collections/object/9545,19969F,Asian,false,Samurai Cuirass Side Piece,,,"Gift of Edward Bedloe, 1897","Back right side section of a black lacquered, rawhide, five-section, samurai cuirass (nerigawa kuro urushi tatehagi go-mai-do). This section of armor is hinged on one side where it connects to the back section of armor. The cuirass is secured by a tweed cord that reaches from the back right side section to the front section of the cuirass. This design allows the wearer to easily put on or remove the cuirass when assembled. This back right side section of the cuirass is constructed of a large plate made of rawhide and coated with black lacquer. The upper-most plate (waki-ita), lying below the armpit, is covered with badly faded stenciled leather. This plate is shaped like an ""L"" and has a toggle at the top to further secure it to the back section of the cuirass. This upper plate is connected to the main body of the armor section with tweed cross knot lacing.

https://penn.museum/collections/object/A 6 lame pendant-like tasset (gessan), hangs from the bottom of this section of the cuirass (eight total tassets when the cuirass is assembled). The lames get progressively wider as they advance down the gessan. Each rawhide lame is coated with black lacquer, though much of it has chipped off. The lames are connected to one another with faded blue lacing in the sugake-odoshi style. The bottom lame showcases a row of tweed lacing above a bottom row of faded orange lacing in a cross knot pattern. Tweed laces also line the left and right edges of the throat guard.",Japan,,Japanese,,,,"Lacquer,Textile",,,,,,-1897,,1897,,,,,,,,
