        "A revolutionary, collaborative approach to design and construction project delivery Integrating Project Delivery is the first book-length discussion of IPD, the emergent project delivery method that draws on each stakeholder's unique knowledge to address problems before they occur. Written by authors with over a decade of research and practical experience, this book provides a primer on IPD for architects, designers, and students interested in this revolutionary approach to design and construction. With a focus on IPD in everyday operation, coverage includes a detailed explanation and analysis of IPD guidelines, and case studies that show how real companies are applying these guidelines on real-world projects. End-of-chapter questions help readers quickly review what they've learned, and the online forum allows them to share their insights and ideas with others who either have or are in the process of implementing IPD themselves. Integrating Project Delivery brings together the owners, architect, engineers, and contractors early in the development stage to ensure that problems are caught early, and to address them in a collaborative way. This book describes the parameters of this new, more efficient approach, with expert insight on real-world implementation. Compare traditional procurement with IPD Understand IPD guidelines, and how they're implemented Examine case studies that illustrate everyday applications Communicate with other IPD adherents in the online forum The IPD approach revolutionizes not only the workflow, but the relationships between the stakeholders - the atmosphere turns collaborative, and the team works together toward a shared goal instead of viewing one another as obstructions to progress. Integrated Project Delivery provides a deep exploration of this approach, with practical guidance and expert insight."

        "The series is devoted to the publication of monographs and high-level textbooks in mathematics, mathematical methods and their applications. Apart from covering important areas of current interest, a major aim is to make topics of an interdisciplinary nature accessible to the non-specialist. The works in this series are addressed to advanced students and researchers in mathematics and theoretical physics. In addition, it can serve as a guide for lectures and seminars on a graduate level. The series de Gruyter Studies in Mathematics was founded ca. 30 years ago by the late Professor Heinz Bauer and Professor Peter Gabriel with the aim to establish a series of monographs and textbooks of high standard, written by scholars with an international reputation presenting current fields of research in pure and applied mathematics. While the editorial board of the Studies has changed with the years, the aspirations of the Studies are unchanged. In times of rapid growth of mathematical knowledge carefully written monographs and textbooks written by experts are needed more than ever, not least to pave the way for the next generation of mathematicians. In this sense the editorial board and the publisher of the Studies are devoted to continue the Studies as a service to the mathematical community. Please submit any book proposals to Niels Jacob.",

        "The first study to explore the crucial influence of Kurt\nWeill on operas and musicals by Marc Blitzstein and Leonard\nBernstein. Theodor Adorno famously proclaimed that the\nmodel of Kurt Weill could not be repeated. Yet Weill's stage works\nset an inescapable precedent for composers on both sides of the\nAtlantic. Rebecca Schmid explores how Weill's formal innovations in\nparticular laid the groundwork for operas and musicals by Marc\nBlitzstein and Leonard Bernstein, although both composers resisted\nor downplayed his aesthetic contribution to American tradition.\nComparative analysis based on Harold Bloom's Anxiety of Influence\nand other modes of intertextuality reveals that the principles of\nWeill's opera reform would catalyze an indigenous movement in\nsophisticated, socially engaged music theatre. Weill,\nBlitzstein, and Bernstein: A Study of Influence focuses on\nworks that represent different phases of Weill's mission to renew\nthe genre of opera, evolving from Die Dreigroschenoper to\nthe musical play Lady in the Dark and the Broadway Opera\nStreet Scene . Blitzstein and Bernstein in turn defied\nformal boundaries with The Cradle Will Rock ,\nRegina , Trouble in Tahiti , Candide, and\nWest Side Story - part of a short-lived movement in\nmid-twentieth century America that coincided with a renaissance for\nWeill's German-period works following the premiere of Blitzstein's\ntranslation, The Threepenny Opera , under Bernstein's\nbaton. The unpublished A Pray by Blecht , for which\nBernstein rejoined Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins, his\ncollaborators on West Side Story , deepens the connection\nof Bernstein's aesthetic to Weill.",
