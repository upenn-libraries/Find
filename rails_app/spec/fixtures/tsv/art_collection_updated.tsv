Awesome Steel	Calder, Alexander	Alexander Calder is widely credited as the originator of the mobile, and is one of the first people to create monumental abstract public art. Both Calder’s father and grandfather are eminent sculptors with prominence in Philadelphia. Interestingly, Alexander Calder originally studied Mechanical Engineering before turning to art in the 1920s. His mastery and use of industrial materials epitomize his technical skill developed in tandem with his engineering degree. Celebrated throughout his career for his innovative use of sound and motion in his work, Calder won the grand prize for sculpture at the 1952 Venice Biennale. The maquette for <em>Jerusalem Stabile</em> holds the distinction of being the last and largest maquette that Calder ever made. A version of the work is in Holland Square in Jerusalem. Calder traveled to Jerusalem, chose the location for the sculpture, and designed the stabile with the location in mind.
